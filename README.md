# Jacob Hargraves Portfolio

## Description
Welcome to my portfolio! In this website I showcase some of my favorite projects that I've worked on. You'll also learn a little bit about my background, interests, and skills!

## The Build
To build my portfolio I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I followed a few tutorials for learning how to create some fall in animations, custom buttons, and other elements of the site. To simplify styling, I used Bootstrap.

## Usage
This is a simple one page website so just scroll to check it out! You can also download my resume and view my contact information!
